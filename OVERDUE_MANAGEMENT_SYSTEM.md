# 📅 Comprehensive Overdue Post Management System

## 🎯 **System Overview**

Our PostWizz application now includes a sophisticated overdue post management system that automatically handles ALL possible scenarios when scheduled posts become overdue. The system categorizes posts by severity and applies appropriate actions.

## 🔄 **Automatic Processing Categories**

### ✅ **On-Time Posts** (Due now - within 5 minutes)
- **Action**: Publish immediately with highest priority
- **Status**: Normal publishing flow
- **User Notice**: None needed

### ⏰ **Recently Overdue** (5 minutes - 1 hour)
- **Action**: Publish normally without warning
- **Reasoning**: Minor delays are acceptable for social media
- **Status**: Published as normal
- **User Notice**: None (considered normal variance)

### ⚠️ **Moderately Overdue** (1 - 24 hours)
- **Action**: Publish with overdue notice appended to content
- **Content Addition**: "⏰ Note: This post was scheduled earlier but was X hours overdue."
- **Status**: Published with warning
- **User Notice**: Visible in post content

### 🚨 **Severely Overdue** (1 - 7 days)
- **Action**: Attempt to publish with warning OR mark as failed
- **Strategy**: Try publishing but handle LinkedIn connection issues gracefully
- **Content Addition**: "⏰ Note: This post was scheduled earlier but was X days overdue."
- **Fallback**: Mark as failed if publishing fails
- **User Notice**: Activity log entry

### 💀 **Critically Overdue** (> 7 days)
- **Action**: Automatically mark as failed
- **Reasoning**: Content likely no longer relevant
- **Status**: Failed with explanation
- **User Notice**: "Post was critically overdue and automatically marked as failed. Please reschedule if still needed."
