# LinkedIn PostAI Component

## Overview

This component provides a streamlined way to create LinkedIn posts with or without images. The main improvements include:

1. A single unified interface with a toggle for adding images
2. Support for both single image and multi-image carousel posts
3. Smart content generation based on text input and image analysis
4. Seamless integration with LinkedIn posting APIs

## Components

### PostAI.tsx

The core component that handles:
- Text input for the post
- Toggle for enabling/disabling images
- Selection between single and multi-image modes
- Image upload and preview
- AI content generation based on user input and images

### NewUnifiedPostCreator.tsx

A wrapper component that:
- Manages the overall flow of the post creation process
- Handles authentication with LinkedIn
- Provides content review and editing
- Publishes posts to LinkedIn with appropriate formatting

## Flow

1. User enters text in the main input field
2. If desired, user toggles "Post with Image" switch
3. User selects between single image or multi-image mode
4. User uploads image(s)
5. When clicking "Enhance & Preview", the system:
   - For text-only: Generates optimized LinkedIn content
   - For single image: Analyzes the image and enhances the text
   - For multi-image: Creates carousel-optimized content based on images
6. User reviews and can edit the generated content
7. User publishes directly to LinkedIn

## API Integration

The component works with the following MCP API endpoints:
- `create-post`: For text-only posts creation and publishing
- `analyze-image-structured-post`: For image analysis and content generation during preview
- `analyze-image-structured-post-with-image`: For publishing single image posts
- `linkedin-post-with-multiple-images`: For publishing multi-image carousel posts
- `analyze-image-and-post`: For content regeneration

## Improvements

This new implementation offers several advantages over the previous version:
- Simplified user interface with fewer steps
- Single cohesive flow instead of separate tabs
- More intuitive image handling
- Proper preview of content with images before publishing
- Streamlined code structure that's easier to maintain
